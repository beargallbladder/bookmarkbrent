## DOM Selectors

The extension automatically looks for common chat UI patterns to detect messages. If messages aren't being captured properly, the extension may need to be updated to match Ford's specific website structure.

**What are DOM selectors?**
DOM selectors are like "addresses" that tell the extension where to find chat messages on the webpage. Think of them as instructions like "look for any element with the class name 'chat-message'" or "find elements marked as 'user' messages."

The extension currently searches for these patterns:
```javascript
const selectors = [
  '.chat-message',
  '.message-bubble',
  '[data-role="user"]',
  '[data-role="assistant"]',
  // Add Ford-specific selectors here
];
```

**If messages aren't being captured:**
1. Contact your development team to update the selectors
2. Or share the Ford AI Notebook's HTML structure with a developer
3. They can modify `content.js` to match Ford's specific chat layout

## Development

To modify the extension:

1. Edit the files as needed
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click the refresh icon on the Codex Watcher card
4. Reload the Ford AI Notebook page

## Icons

Generate icons by:
1. Opening `icons/generate-icons.html` in a browser
2. Right-clicking each canvas
3. Saving as PNG with the indicated filename
